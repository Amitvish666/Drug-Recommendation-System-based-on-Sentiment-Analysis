💊 Drug Recommendation System Based on Sentiment Analysis
📌 Project Overview

# Drug-Recommendation-System-based-on-Sentiment-Analysis
A machine learning–based Drug Recommendation System that analyzes patient reviews using sentiment analysis to recommend effective medicines. The system processes textual feedback, classifies sentiments, and ranks drugs based on overall user experience, helping users and healthcare analysts make data-driven decisions.

The Drug Recommendation System based on Sentiment Analysis is a machine learning–driven project that analyzes patient reviews to evaluate drug effectiveness and recommend suitable medications. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system classifies sentiments expressed in user reviews and aggregates them to generate meaningful, data-driven drug recommendations.

This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning, NLP, and sentiment analysis in the healthcare domain.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze patient drug reviews using sentiment analysis

Classify reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments

Rank and recommend drugs based on aggregated sentiment scores

Provide an interpretable, data-driven recommendation approach

🧠 How It Works

Data Collection – Uses patient drug review datasets

Text Preprocessing – Cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal

Feature Extraction – TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words

Model Training – Machine Learning models for sentiment classification

Sentiment Aggregation – Scores aggregated per drug

Recommendation Engine – Drugs ranked based on sentiment performance

🛠️ Tech Stack
